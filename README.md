# Transaction Manager (Technical Challenge)

Java-based application to store and retrieve purchase transactions, with support for currency conversion using historical exchange rates.

> **This project was developed as part of a real technical challenge for a Java Developer position.**  
> Certain technical decisions reflect restrictions defined by the hiring team — for example, **the use of Spring Web was explicitly forbidden**.

## 🧾 Challenge Overview

### Requirement 1: Store a Purchase Transaction
The application must accept and store a purchase transaction with:
- **Description** (max 50 characters)
- **Transaction date** (valid ISO format)
- **Amount in USD** (positive and rounded to two decimal places)
- **Unique identifier** generated by the system

### Requirement 2: Retrieve and Convert a Transaction
The application allows retrieving a stored transaction and converting its value to a specified currency using the official [Treasury Reporting Rates](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-reporting-rates-exchange/treasury-reporting-rates-of-exchange). Key rules include:
- Conversion must use the **exchange rate equal to or earlier than the transaction date**
- The rate must be **within the last 6 months** from the transaction date
- If no valid rate is found in the time window, the system returns an error
